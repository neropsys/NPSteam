# NPSteam
- Now Playing! (on Steam) 
- It posts what you are playing on Steam automatically. On Twitter.
  - (No Facebook. Sorry)

# How to use
- NO mouse clicks.
- NO keyboard types required.
- Just run the program. EZ GAME EZ LIFE

# Requirements
- [**.NET 4.5**](http://www.microsoft.com/ko-kr/download/details.aspx?id=30653) 
- Steam Overlay is a MUST. (thing that pops out when you shift-tab)
- 스팀 오버레이 꼭 켜주세요 (쉬프트-탭 누르면 뜨는거)


# Issues
- Game titles are from Steam\steamapps\common folder. 
 - So it won't work on any games(including non-steam) that aren't in there. 
- 게임 이름은 Steam\steamapps\common 폴더에서 따옵니다
 - 그래서 이 폴더 안에 없는 게임(비스팀 포함)들은 안될거에요.
